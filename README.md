# Django_ToDo_App
A To-Do task keeper web app has been created using Django and Sqlite.

I have implemented CRUD functionality and User Authentication and Authorization.

I have used HTML and CSS with Django Template Language to genarate Front-end.

"My notes while building this app" Folder contains some files, that I have created to explain some of the working functionality of some django concept, which I feel
useful to know.
